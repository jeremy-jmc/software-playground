    abstract = {Recent advances in deep machine learning have enabled artificial intelligence-driven development environments (AIDEs). AIDEs are programming tools that, given comments or starter code, can generate code solution suggestions. As the accuracy of these tools continues to increase, one particular AIDE from Github, Copilot, has been gaining significant attention for its performance and ease of use. The rise of Copilot suggests that code solution generation tools will soon be commonplace in both the industry and in computer science courses, with expert and novice programmers alike benefiting from using these tools. More specifically for novices, the effects of Copilot on the process of learning to code are mostly unknown. In this paper, we perform initial explorations into these effects. Using introductory computer science and data science courses, we evaluate Copilot-generated programming assignment solutions for correctness, style, skill level appropriateness, grade scores, and potential plagiarism. Our findings indicate Copilot generates mostly unique code that can solve introductory assignments with human-graded scores ranging from 68\% to 95\%. Based on these results, we provide recommendations for educators to help adapt their courses to incorporate new AIDE-based programming workflows.},
